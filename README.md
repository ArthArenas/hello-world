# hello-world
I'm just learning how to use GitHub for the first time.

My name is Arturo Arenas, I am a mexican sophomore student at ITESM Campus Monterrey and enjoy solving math and programming problems !
As a mexican, I can tell you that the tutorial guy praising moon tacos is not nuts enough. I've been in Jupiter (where mexican tacos originally come from) and they taste far better than any other tacos in the galaxy.
